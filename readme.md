So I being asked to answer these questions below:

> Use the following sentiment data
>
> https://www.kaggle.com/code/kevinismail/training-lstm-sentiment-analysis-bahasa.
>
> 1. Show the word embedding results of the document using TF-IDF [x] <br />
> 2. Show the word embedding results from the document with GloVe [] <br />
> 3. Show the word embedding results of the document with Fast-Text [x] <br />
> 4. Show the word embedding results from the document using Word2Vec- CBOW [x] <br />
> 5. Show the word embedding results from the document using Word2Vec- skip-gram [x] <br />
> 6. Create a classification with LSTM [] and GRU [] <br />
> 7. Report the performance results of Accuracy, Precision, and Recall at least 2 (example glove with GRU, Fasttext + LSTM) <br />

This repository is dedicated to solving these questions above. 

You may reference the code within this repository, however, keep things
